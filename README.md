# Name of the project:
**Multithreaded Programming and Synchronization**

# Project Description:
In this project, we have worked with the **_Threads_** subsystem of Linux. This is the part of
Linux that supports multiple concurrent activities within the kernel. We have created a mini project that creates multiple threads, and demonstrates the problems that arise when multiple threads perform unsynchronized access to shared data, and rectified these problems by introducing synchronization (in the form of **_Pthreads mutex_**) into the code.
